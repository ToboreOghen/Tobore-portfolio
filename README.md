# ðŸ§® Python Tkinter Calculator

This is a simple **calculator app with GUI** built using Pythonâ€™s `tkinter`.

The idea came after a friend told me:  
> "Guy, this calculator is cool, but it would be better if I could see it run like a proper calculator with buttons."

So I upgraded my old calculator project to give it a face. Now it doesnâ€™t just calculate in the console â€” it runs like a real app that you can click and interact with.

## âœ¨ Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear button (AC)
